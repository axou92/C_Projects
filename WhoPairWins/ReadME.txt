--------------------------------------------------------- DESCRIPTION ----------------------------------------------------------

This application is a game to play and have fun with your friends without a limit of person and age.
The principle is simple: Know who thinks the same and who thinks differently.
Depending on a set time, you need to assemble 2 by 2 images that will be presented by your computer.
Each of the 11 images can be used only once, so one image must remain.
When the time is over, you have to compare with the others which have the same pair and which have the same remaining image.
Moreover, you can add your images.
To do that, add your images in the following images folder:
	YourPath\WhoPairWins\Images (For the shortcut application)
	YourPath\WhoPairWins\WhoPairWins (For the code application)
